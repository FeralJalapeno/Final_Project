                   <p>Mbembe uses the example of Cecil Rhodes to expand on this. Naturally, I will do the same. Whether or not people still disagree, Rhodes is part of the “race of men who were convinced that to be black is a liability” (Mbembe, 2015 p.2). The fact is that he stole, exploited and mass murdered countless black people in Southern Africa. He used his financial and political power from the British government to dispossess black people of their ancestral lands. Essentially, the settler stealing from the native. Of course, this act of theft was done through gruesome and aggressive means. After all, the natives did not simply agree to give up their land – their homes. But then why are so many people still in denial of Rhodes being an evil and racist excuse of a human being? If we look at a different example, one of Lewis and Clarke, we can understand how perspective has quite the influential role when it comes to storytelling. In Ella Inglebret’s curriculum, she focuses on the storytelling of the Lewis and Clark expedition. She points out how the story of their travels has exclusively been told from their perspectives for over 150 years. This results in the story dismissing the experience and encounters the Native American people had with these explorers. (Inglebret, 2013, p.1). Only in recent years has the Natives’ experiences and history with Lewis and Clark been incorporated in how this story is told. Essentially, the perspective of Lewis and Clark painted them as wondrous explorers who assisted the natives. The actual reality is that they forced their own people to migrate and invade the natives’ land. With them, they brought disease that decimated many native tribes. Yet, for over 150 years, that side of the story was never shared. Although changes are being made now, on how the story is being told, the damage is still done and many of the natives still aren’t understood as people who were wronged and suffered. The way the education works is still in favor of the settlers, Lewis and Clarkes’s perspective, not the natives.</p>

                    <p>Now, this situation tells us that the perspectives in which stories are told has influence as well as importance. Depending on what perspective the audience receives the story from ultimately changes how they feel and interpret the story – how they interpret and believe history. Yet, if we truly believe we are entering an era of freedom and equality, why do statues of colonial villains still stand? Why are they still looked up upon in public and political spaces? If you are unaware, in 2015 a statue of Rhodes was removed from the University of Cape Town. It was met with cheering students who protested for months that the statue of a British colonialist should be removed. The point was that such a statue held major symbolic power that essentially idolized a man that exploited black lives and their land. As Mbembe wonderfully puts it, the argument should have never been about whether the statue should be removed. The argument should have always been WHY it took so long to get rid of that statue. This structure of a colonialist stood as the main hall that held almost every ceremony and graduation was named after Rhodes’s racist and destructive lieutenant, Jameson. Should I even bother mentioning how Rhode’s University is still called RHODES BLUDY UNIVERSITY? Instead, this institution just removed the bust of Rhodes a their main entrance in order to avoid the discussion around changing it’s name… pathetic.</p>

                        <p> Many love to argue on how the Rhodes statue should remain since Rhodes , himself, ever so kindly gave up “his” land and money in order to build these universities. But how did he end up is possession of that land in the first place? Ah yes, he stole it. His statue has absolutely nothing to do with the campus, especially after 20+ years of “freedom” (Mbembe, 2015 p.3). As Mbembe explains, removing such statues is one of the many, many ways in which we can demythologize white history and finally put it to rest. No longer should the white man’s savior complex be continued but ended as the truth is told as the new norm. As mentioned before, to demythologize whiteness, we must demythologize specific versions of history – tell it from a native perspective.</p>
