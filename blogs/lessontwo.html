                      <p>Catherine Hoppers investigates the challenges of integrating indigenous thoughts and practises into our current knowledge systems. Mbembe, Mignolo and Welsh speak on the decolonisation of knowledge in great depth that addresses the colonial mindset that continues to plague our knowledge systems and way of thinking. This blog post will focus on Hopper’s paper, “Indigenous Knowledge and the Integration of Knowledge Systems: Towards a philosophy of articulation” (Hoppers, p.388).</p>

                        <p> To begin, Hoppers mentions how there is a “major transformation and democratisation processes being implemented under the new dispensation. Several macro-level policies provide frameworks for understanding the equity, empowerment and development thrusts in government policies—for example, the Reconstruction and Development Programme (RDP), the policy of Growth, Equity and Reconstruction (GEAR), the National System of Innovation, and the African Renaissance.” (Hoppers, p.388)</p>
                        
                            <p>These frameworks provide an agenda that involves identity reconstruction and innovation, human rights, sustainable development, and democratisation across Africa. In particular, the African Resistance focuses on recognizing Africa and its many languages, with the inclusion of rewriting the main principles of history.</p>
                        
                                <p> Hoppers also mentions that the world stands at a “crossroad” where it searches for new “human centred visions of development in health, in preserving and conserving biodiversity, in human rights, and in the alleviation of poverty” (Hoppers, p.388). From this we understand that Africa is attempting to find its own renaissance and terms of development. We must understand that the effects of globalisation have brought affluence to a very small minority of people. With this, human existence is centred around the suffering and dispossession of others. The effects of colonisation caused a major cultural loss within African societies that have led to their collapse. I’ll say it again, globalisation only assists a small part of the people on this earth. It is something that “n is threatening the appropriation of the collective knowledge of non-Western societies into proprietary knowledge for the profit of a few.” (Hoppers, p.389)</p>
                        
                                    <p> Now, despite that being said, there seem to be a number of agencies within colonial benefitting countries (The United States) that have conventions that focus on addressing issues within diversity and indigenous people’s rights and their knowledge. It may seem that there is a drive towards a change that benefits and includes indigenous people into the knowledge system. However, the agencies involved in these conventions do not seem to practise the point these conferences seem to hold. Let’s look at the example Hopper provides;</p>
                        
                                        <p> “Also involved, playing an active though ethically unclear role, are the Trans-National Corporations (TNCs) with immense financial power, but with short-term profit motives keen to exploit genetic and other resources from the so-called Third World countries. The TNCs are protected by the agreements initiated at the Uruguay Round, which led to the formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The WTO is the global trade “police” interested in eliminating all trade barriers worldwide. However, it is also the WTO that legislates the idea of intellectual property rights (IPRs) in a manner that assumes individual ownership (a Western phenomenon) as a universal phenomenon and excludes the notion of “collectivity” that characterises ownership of IPRs in many societies in the Third World.” (Hoppers, p.389)</p>
                                        The important thing to note is that individual ownership is a Western phenomenon, therefore it is not an indigenous or cultural phenomenon. The issue is that this Western phenomenon is assumed as a universal practise which is problematic in numerous ways. The WTO wants to establish new regimes of intellectual property rights when Third World countries are in now position to actively participate in this (Hoppers, p.389). Because of colonisation, Third World countries cannot afford or still need to invest in the systems that will provide the education and create skills to manage IPRS. Therefore, its people already run at a loss. It is vital to note that many existing IPR systems “encourage the appropriation of traditional knowledge for commercial use; moreover, without the fair sharing of benefits with the holders of knowledge.” (Hoppers, p.389) These systems revolve around this idea of “private ownership” which excludes the indigenous ideologies around collective creation and ownership of knowledge.</p>

                                        <p> To assist in understanding how dangerous the phenomenon of private ownership is, let us discuss an example:For context, let me tell you about a traditional Vietnamese dish called Pho (say it like fuh). This dish is commonly sold as well as enjoyed by Vietnamese people. Now that there is an understanding of what Pho is, let’s get to the example…</p>
                                        
                                        <p> In 2013 a white-owned restaurant in the U.K trademarked the word “Pho” and then proceeded to sue a small Vietnamese restaurant for using the word “Pho” in their name. Yes, the white people, Stephen, and Juliette, tried to sue a Vietnamese owned restaurant for using a traditional/native word that has been in their culture for centuries. The owner, Stephen, has also claimed that absolutely no one who works at his restaurant are Vietnamese. If you think that’s not bizarre enough, how about the fact that these white owners of a Vietnamese restaurant make absolutely no traditional Vietnamese food. Instead, they have heavily altered the traditional dishes for it to seem more “palatable” for Western consumption. Therefore, this “Vietnamese” restaurant is simply white-washing traditional Vietnamese food to suit the western aesthetic.</p>
                                        
                                        <p> This is a prime example of how dangerous and ignorant private ownership can be. This push in our society to claim things as our own is selfish as it often comes from taking advantage of indigenous and traditional people who stray away from the western ideal. Looking at this example, we see that this notion of Pho is shared and therefore considered a collective knowledge amongst Vietnamese people. Vietnam and its people do not hold legal actions towards non-Vietnamese people who cook or consume Pho. Nor do they sue any restaurant that uses the words Pho in its menus. It’s like trying to trade mark “chicken noodle soup” … it seems stupid until we involve words that are not English. Words we typically won’t understand.</p>
                                        
                                        <p> Thankfully, these white owners lost their case and received extreme backlash. Majority of these types of cases do not always have a happy ending. In many aspects of our lives, such as medications and clothing, there is a case of private ownership that has stolen from an indigenous/traditional practise. Therefore, present IPRS appropriate traditional knowledge without benefitting the original shareholders of that very knowledge. This violation of indigenous culture pushes this serious need for innovation in the intellectual property regime itself (Mashelkar 2000).</p>
